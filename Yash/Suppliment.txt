1) List 
  $ ls t*
  #This gets files/directories starting with t.
  #If the directory name is starting with t, it will also show the files in that directory
    
2) Process and Kill

$ ps  ## process running for current user only !
$ ps -ef ## - of all process running 
$ top ## top process running in descending order

To kill a process of a particular task

$ ps -ef | grep firefox 
$ kill -9 pid ## pid from previous command. For -9, do a man

or directly

$ pkill firefox ## process name

Now, you can find the PID for shutdown

3) Download videos, this is not possible with wget. It will only get what is available as view page source.
However, it can create entired html directory structure of the page including js, css and html.			
		
4) For grep commands , some good examples - https://alvinalexander.com/unix/edu/examples/grep.shtml

5) "This incident will be reported", the related log could be at 
	/var/log/auth.log
	/var/spool/mail/root

6) "tr" command.. create new line after space of every word
	$ tr -cs "[:alpha:]" "\n" < file1 > file2 
	$ cp file2 file1  # put them together now
	
7) Some permissions related commands that you could execute in workspace or otherwise !
Make sure you have required permissions. Check with TAs on this

a)Create User 
	$ adduser itws1
	$ adduser itws1-noperm

	This will create user with no home directory. 	For home directory - use -m option
	
	$ adduser -m itws1
	$ adduser -m itws1-noperm

	sudo passwd itws1
		<enter password twice>
	sudo passwd itws1-noperm
		<enter password twice>

b) Delete User		
	$ deluser itws1
	$ deluser itws1-noperm

c) You could also add a user to a group
	create group
   $ sudo groupadd itws1-group1
   
   $ sudo adduser itws1 itws1-group1    
   
   You can add user to multiple groups as well using "usermod" command

 Going forward, i will use this group and users in the class  
   
d) $ id itws1 
		this will give you what group(s) user belongs to. 
	
User database - To get a list of user types

e)	$ cat /etc/passwd
	
Group database - To get list of groups that users belong to  

f)	$ cat /etc/group

g)	$ cat /etc/group |cut -d: -f1

To get a list of all groups. Now try to get a user of a specific group 
		
To get files owned by itws1
h)	$ find /home -group itws1

Files are created with with default rw, r and r permissions. You could modify permissions changing
.bashrc with following entry -  "umask" 

There is no single command to provide file access with permissions to a user.
Please try commands chown and chmod for file access.  

Similarly for copying files from one user to another, it is a combination of cp, chown and chmod

We will discuss this more in file system and inode
